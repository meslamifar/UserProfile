Step 1 of the technical assessment:

To run this project locally, first run "npm install" to install all the dependencies in package.json. After that, run "node server.js" and navigate to localhost:8080.
Node web server listens to port 8080 on your local machine and responds to a get request by rendering index.html page, i.e. hello world.
