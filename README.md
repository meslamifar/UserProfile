Step 1 of the technical assessment:
To run this project locally, first run "npm install" in command prompt on Windows machine to install all the dependencies in package.json. After that run "node server.js" and navigate to localhost:8080.
Node web server listens to port 8080 on your local machine and responds to any request by rendering index.html page, i.e. hello world.
